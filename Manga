   "description":"The year is 1600. Ten years have passed since Oda Nobunaga unified Japan. When Nobunaga realizes that he is dying, and since it would be boring to choose a successor based on a pecking order, he decides that he would hand over the country to the person who produced the strongest warrior! The warlords, whose dreams of unifying Japan had been dashed, set up their own strongest warriors and set their sights on claiming the kingdom!",
